          process: \n 1. Agent on managed cluster creates CSR on hub with cluster
          UID and agent name. 2. Agent on managed cluster creates ManagedCluster on
          hub. 3. Cluster admin on hub approves the CSR for UID and agent name of
          the ManagedCluster. 4. Cluster admin sets spec.acceptClient of ManagedCluster
          to true. 5. Cluster admin on managed cluster creates credential of kubeconfig
          to hub. \n Once the hub creates the cluster namespace, the Klusterlet agent
          on the ManagedCluster pushes the credential to the hub to use against the
          kube-apiserver of the ManagedCluster."
