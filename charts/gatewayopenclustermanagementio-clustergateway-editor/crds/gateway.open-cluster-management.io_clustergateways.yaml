          ClusterGateway is an extension model for ManagedCluster which implements
          the Tier-II cluster model based on OCM's original abstraction of
          ManagedCluster. The Tier-II cluster model should be highly protected under
          RBAC policies and only the admin shall have the access to view the content
          of cluster credentials.
