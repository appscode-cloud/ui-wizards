  ClusterGateway is an extension model for ManagedCluster which implements
  the Tier-II cluster model based on OCM's original abstraction of
  ManagedCluster. The Tier-II cluster model should be highly protected under
  RBAC policies and only the admin shall have the access to view the content
  of cluster credentials.
