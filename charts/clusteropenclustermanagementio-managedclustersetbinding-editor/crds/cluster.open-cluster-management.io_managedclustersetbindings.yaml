          ManagedClusterSetBinding projects a ManagedClusterSet into a certain namespace.
          You can create a ManagedClusterSetBinding in a namespace and bind it to a
          ManagedClusterSet if both have a RBAC rules to CREATE on the virtual subresource of managedclustersets/bind.
          Workloads that you create in the same namespace can only be distributed to ManagedClusters
          in ManagedClusterSets that are bound in this namespace by higher-level controllers.
