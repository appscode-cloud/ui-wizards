        description: AppliedManifestWork represents an applied manifestwork on managed
          cluster that is placed on a managed cluster. An AppliedManifestWork links
          to a manifestwork on a hub recording resources deployed in the managed cluster.
          When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed
          cluster can delete appliedmanifestwork to remove resources deployed by the
          agent. The name of the appliedmanifestwork must be in the format of {hash
          of hub's first kube-apiserver url}-{manifestwork name}
