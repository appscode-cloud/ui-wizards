                  NodeDeletionTimeout defines how long the controller will attempt to delete the Node that the Machine
                  hosts after the Machine is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.

                  This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
                  This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                  with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                  machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                  generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                  able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                  and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                  be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.
