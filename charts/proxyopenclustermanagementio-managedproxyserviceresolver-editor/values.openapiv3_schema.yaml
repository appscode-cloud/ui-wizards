  ManagedProxyServiceResolver defines a target service that need to expose from a set of managed clusters to the hub.
  To access a target service on a managed cluster from hub. First, users need to apply a proper ManagedProxyServiceResolver.
  The managed cluster should match the ManagedClusterSet in the ManagedProxyServiceResolver.Spec. The serviceNamespace and serviceName should also match the target service.
  A usage example: /examples/access-other-services/main.go
