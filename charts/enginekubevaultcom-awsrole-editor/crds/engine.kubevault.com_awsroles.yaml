                  The default TTL for STS credentials. When a TTL is not specified when STS credentials are requested,
                  and a default TTL is specified on the role, then this default TTL will be used.

                  The IAM policy document for the role. The behavior depends on the credential type.
                  With iam_user, the policy document will be attached to the IAM user generated and
                  augment the permissions the IAM user has. With assumed_role and federation_token,
                  the policy document will act as a filter on what the credentials can do.

                      This field is effectively required, but due to backwards compatibility is
                      allowed to be empty. Instances of this type with an empty value here are
                      almost certainly wrong.
